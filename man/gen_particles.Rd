\usage{
gen_particles(
  num_particles,
  mu,
  sig2,
  particle,
  ...,
  mix_ratio = c(0.5, 0.5, 0),
  prop_mu = NULL,
  prop_sig2 = NULL,
  epsilon = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{num_particles}{The total number of particles to generate using a
combination of the three methods.}

\item{mu}{A vector of means for the multivariate normal}

\item{sig2}{A covariate matrix for the multivariate normal}

\item{particle}{A particle (re proposals for latent variables)}

\item{mix_ratio}{A vector of floats betwen 0 and 1 and summing to 1 which
give the ratio of particles to generate from the population level
parameters, the individual random effects and the conditional parameters
repectively}

\item{epsilon}{Reduce the variance for the individual level samples by this
factor}
}
\value{
The new proposals
}
\description{
Generate particles for a particular subject from a mix of population level
(hierarchical) distribution, from the particles (containing individual level
distribution) and/or from the conditional on accepted individual level
particles, a more efficient prposal method.
}
\details{
This function is used in burnin, adaptation and sampling using various
combinations of the arguments.
