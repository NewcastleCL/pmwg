Title: Particle Based Samplers for MCMC
Version: 0.0.0.9025
Maintainer: Gavin Cooper <gavin@gavincooper.net>
Description: Contains implementations of particle based sampling methods for model parameter estimation. Primarily an implementation of the Particle Metropolis within Gibbs sampler outlined in the paper available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10089, it also contains code for covariance estimation and time varying models.
