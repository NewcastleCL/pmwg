Description: Provides an R implementation of the Particle Metropolis within
    Gibbs sampler for model parameter and random effect estimation. Based on
    the paper at <doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2020.102368> and on the Matlab
    code available at <http://osf.io/5b4w3> written by David Gunawan. An HTML
	tutorial document describing the package is available at
	<https://newcastlecl.github.io/samplerDoc/> and includes several detailed
	examples.
